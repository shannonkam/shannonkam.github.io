## Deciding my Major

Growing up, my favorite subject in school has always been math. I loved it because it didn’t involve memorizing dates or looking for elements in a periodic table. Since then, my love for math only continued to grow. My interest in technology has always been there, from playing games on the Nintendo Wii to watching YouTube videos for fun. Thus, combining my love for both math and technology, I decided to major in computer engineering.

## *Chuckles* I'm in Danger

Even with all my love for math and computers, I had no coding experience going into my first year of college. C was the first language I ever learned and it did not go too great, especially since this was the semester that COVID hit and classes had to make an abrupt shift to an online format. My foundation of coding knowledge was not as sturdy as I would’ve liked. During my sophomore year, I got to learn C++ and the uses of Object Oriented Programming. I used what knowledge I had of C to try to understand C++. Learning this language actually helped me grow a love for programming. The projects we did in this class were difficult at times, but once you figured it out, it was very rewarding. Then, in my junior year, some concepts regarding pipelines and assembly language were harder to grasp. I enjoyed the experience nonetheless and hope to better sharpen those skills in the future.

## Going Forward

This semester I am taking a computer science course that has really reignited my love for coding. Having had a rocky start in programming, I hope that this semester will allow me to polish some software engineering skills that may be lacking thus far. I am also working on a project in cybersecurity. At this moment in time, I am still unsure of the exact type of job I’d want after graduation. After this semester, my hope is that I’ll better understand what I want to do for the rest of my life.
