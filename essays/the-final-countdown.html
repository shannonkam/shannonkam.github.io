  <p>As I approach the final week of my college journey, I’d like to reflect on one of the most challenging, yet rewarding, classes I’ve ever taken.</p>

<h2 id="course-overview">Course Overview</h2>

<p>Software Engineering II was a course that focused on working with a client to develop a web application based on their needs. The class was randomly split into three teams and each team worked on the same project.</p>

<p>Our clients were staff members for the Information and Computer Sciences department at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The main goal of the web application was to keep track of equipment and room usage on the third floor of the Pacific Ocean Science and Technology (POST) building, as well as provide information about faculty members and computer science clubs.</p>

<p>Our goal was to create a reliable user-friendly website that meets all of their requirements. We worked closely with our clients to ensure that the features of the website were to their liking.</p>

<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>

<p>This course gave me the opportunity to enhance my front-end development skills. Previously, I had mainly used my coding skills to create one-off web pages following certain specifications. I also used my skills in a two-month-long web development project. This class allowed me to exercise skills that I had previously attained and helped me acquire new ones. One such skill was utilizing “user stories” as a tool to figure out what web pages we needed to create and how they connected to each other.</p>

<p>I was also able to improve my project management skills. I learned how to organize customer feedback notes, set realistic deadlines, and coordinate effectively with my team. I gained experience in estimating how long it takes to accomplish certain tasks and gave me a better understanding of what it takes to manage a project successfully.</p>

<p>Working with a team of eight was a great learning experience. Everyone was at a different level, some members were taking the course immediately after Software Engineering I, others had a few years in between the preceding class, and one member had no experience in software engineering whatsoever. I learned how to effectively communicate with my teammates, how to work collaboratively, and how to be a team player. I believe these are essential skills for any job or project that I take on.</p>

<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<p>Looking back, I feel like we could’ve done a lot more with our application, but I am proud of the work we were able to accomplish. Working with a real customer and incorporating their feedback into the project was a valuable experience that helped prepare me for a real world work environment. Throughout the course of this semester, I have cultivated valuable skills and techniques that will definitely benefit me in future endeavors.</p>
