## Software Engineering

It has been about three years since I’ve started my computer engineering journey and two years since I took my first programming class. This past semester, I took a software engineering course that renewed my love for coding. This class challenged everything I knew about programming and made me want to learn more. Web application development was one of the major topics that we covered, however it wasn’t the underlying goal of the course, which was to attain experience with fundamental software engineering concepts. The class covered new software engineering concepts and some that I’d seen before, but never fully acknowledged.

In the following sections, I will be talking about some of the fundamental software engineering concepts that I’ve learned over the course of the semester and how they can be applied to more than just web applications.

## Coding Standards

Coding standards are a uniform format for software engineers to follow to create cleaner, more readable, more efficient code with minimal errors. Following these standards make it easier for others to understand your code without you needing to be there to explain it. It increases efficiency and also helps with the debugging process.

## Agile Project Management

Agile project management is breaking a project down into a sequence of milestones with each milestone containing a set of issues. These issues are then assigned to members of the project team. This concept ensures that the different aspects of a project are completed

## Design Patterns

Design patterns are reusable templates or descriptions on how to solve a common problem when designing an application. 

## Conclusion

Understanding how to apply these fundamental concepts to my code allows me to be a better software developer.
