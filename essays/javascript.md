## Learning JavaScript

C and C++ were the first two programming languages that I got familiar with. They have been my primary languages for the past three years. Though now, with the help of freeCodeCamp and codecademy, I am working on adding another language to my arsenal: JavaScript. So far I’ve only covered the basics, but I find the language to be very easy to learn and use. It also probably helps that many of the concepts I learned in C and C++ are easily adapted to JavaScript. In addition, it is also more convenient and user friendly than the other languages I’ve been using.

## Athletic Software Engineering

A new technique I’m using to learn this language is athletic software engineering. This approach is intense and time-constrained. It revolves around repetition and promotes critical thinking. To strengthen a skill, you must continuously exercise and flex that skill, otherwise you’ll get rusty. Though the learning style stresses me out at times, I find it to be enjoyable and believe that it will help me become competent with JavaScript.

One of the major selling points of this technique is the use of “WODs”. A WOD, or workout of the day, is a short assignment that requires you to exercise specific skills correctly and efficiently within a specified time limit. The time limit varies with the difficulty of the problem. These exercises are done throughout the week and highlight areas that may need improvement. For me, the best part of doing these WODs is the feeling of accomplishment I get when I complete the task correctly with time to spare.
