*In collaboration with [Evan Araki](https://evanaraki.github.io/) and [Melvin Alhambra](https://melvinjae.github.io/)*

## Overview

*Problem*: UH Manoa is a large campus with many events that students may attend. Students not familiar with the campus may not know where certain buildings are. Some events may or may not pique peopleâ€™s interest and just might not be aware of them.

*Solution*: This application shows what events-open to the public-are happening around campus on a specific day [giveaways, free samples, competitions, etc.].

## Mockup

- Navbar that lets you browse events by specific tags/broad categories
- Landing page
- Login Page for site managers/organizations that want to post events
- Form to submit event
- Admin/organization home page
- Calendar page 
- Events page 
- Title 
- Description 
- Location (some kind of maps api)
- Photos (optional) 
- RSVP (if it has)

## Case Ideas

- User browses landing page and looks at event info
  - user >> Landing page. Displays events relevant to day / broad interests (ie: music festival) >>  click on event from list >> event details page
- User searches for specific events and looks at event info 
  - user >> landing page >> use nav bar to search by tags >> list of events with relevant tags >> event details page
- Organization wants to submit an event 
  - Admin >> admin login page >> admin home page >> submit form to site managers for approval to be event host >> account receives authentication >> create event post through admin home page
- Site managers approve submissions and decide if organization is legit 
  - Site manager >> admin login >> admin home page >> can view any admin requests, can view and edit users, can view and edit events (moderation purposes)


## Beyond the Basics

- Map API integration to view location of events
- Messaging system interface
- User file upload (images)
